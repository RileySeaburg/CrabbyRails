<!-- Alert letting the user know to use the release candidate or the cargo crate. Not to use master as it is still in development -->

> Note: Rusty Road is still in development. Please use the release candidate or the cargo crate. Do not use main for production purposes. It is still under heavy development and is not ready for production use.

This version is 0.1.8-beta. It is a release candidate. It contains fixes for the database connection strings specfially PostgreSQL. It should now work on any database conection including a remote one.

## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Rust Needs a Rails

I outlined this in a blog post here: https://rileyseaburg.com/posts/rust-needs-a-rails

- IDEAL: In a perfect world, Rust would have a framework that is as easy to use as Ruby on Rails. It would be
  easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to maintain. It would be fast, secure, and reliable. It would be
  extensible and customizable. It would be a joy to use.
- REALITY: Rust is a powerful language, but it is not easy to use. It is not easy to learn, and it is not easy to
  maintain. It is not fast, secure, or reliable. It is not extensible or customizable. It is not a joy to use even though it is the most loved programming language on [stack overflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages).
- CONSEQUENCES:
  - Web servers are insecure, because most languages are not as secure as Rust.
  - Web servers are slow, because most languages are not as fast as Rust.
  - Web servers are unreliable, because most languages are not as reliable as Rust.
  - Web servers are not extensible or customizable, because most languages are not as extensible or customizable as Rust.
  - Web servers are not a joy to use, because most languages are not as fun to use as Rust.



## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Rusty Road is a framework written in Rust that is based on Ruby on Rails. It is designed to provide the familiar conventions and ease of use of Ruby on Rails, while also taking advantage of the performance and efficiency of Rust.

## :dog: What is Rusty Road <a name = "Rusty_actix"></a>

Rusty Road is a framework written in Rust that is based on Ruby on Rails. It is designed to provide the familiar conventions and ease of use of Ruby on Rails, while also taking advantage of the performance and efficiency of Rust.

Rusty Road is intended to offer developers a powerful and reliable platform for building web applications using Rust, and its name incorporates a rust-themed crab pun in a playful and memorable way.

### Understanding Rusty Road

Rusty Road currently works with the actix web framework, the Diesel ORM, the Tera template engine, the SASS asset pipeline, and the PostgreSQL database. It also uses the dotenv crate to manage environment variables, and it uses the dotenv-linter crate to lint environment variables.

Because Rusty Road uses the actix web framework, the architecture is not exactly MVC

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- Rust is a relatively new language, and it is not as mature as Ruby on Rails.
- Rust is not as easy to use as Ruby on Rails.
- Rust has a borrow checker, which can make it difficult to use.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Rust is required to build and run Rusty Road. You can install Rust using rustup. rustup is a tool that helps manage Rust installations, it allows for installing multiple versions of Rust and switching between them easily.

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
#### Windows
If you are using Windows, you will need to install the Visual C++ build tools. You can install them using the following command:

```
rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

#### Linux
If you are using Linux, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libpq-dev libsqlite3-dev pkg-config openssl sqlite3 postgresql postgresql-contrib 
```

#### Mac
If you are using Mac, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```
brew install openssl sqlite3
```

### Installing

![Rusty Road Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rileyseaburg/rustyroad/master/logo.png)



#### Crates.io
Rusty Road is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rustyroad). You can install it using cargo:

```
cargo install rustyroad
```

Bonus Step #1 (optional): Add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc file to make the rustyroad command available in your terminal:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Bonus Step #2 (optional): Create a symbolic link to the rustyroad command in your ~/.cargo/bin directory.
This will create a symlink from rustyroad to rr inside ~/.cargo/bin/ directory. 
Now you can invoke `rr` command which is just a symlink to rustyroad.

```
sudo ln -s ~/.cargo/bin/rustyroad /usr/local/bin/rr
```

(Windows users can download the executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/RileySeaburg/Rusty-Road/releases) and add it to their PATH.)


#### Installing from source

Clone the repository and run the setup script.

```
git clone https://github.com/RileySeaburg/RustyRoad
```

```
cd RustyRoad
```

```
cargo run
```
