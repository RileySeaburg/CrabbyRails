## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Rust Needs a Rails

I outlined this in a blog post here: https://rileyseaburg.com/posts/rust-needs-a-rails

- IDEAL: In a perfect world, Rust would have a framework that is as easy to use as Ruby on Rails. It would be
  easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to maintain. It would be fast, secure, and reliable. It would be
  extensible and customizable. It would be a joy to use.
- REALITY: Rust is a powerful language, but it is not easy to use. It is not easy to learn, and it is not easy to
  maintain. It is not fast to build with, even though it is secure, there is no framework that is as easy to use as Ruby on Rails.
  [Rust is still the most loved programming language](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages).

and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Understanding the Build Process <a name="understanding_the_build_process"></a>

Before diving into the setup and resolving the known issues, it‚Äôs crucial to understand how the build process works in this project and why certain steps are essential.

#### **Why Use `build.rs`?** <a name="why_use_build_rs"></a>

The `build.rs` file in Rust is a build script, executed before the Rust compiler to perform various tasks, such as compiling linked C libraries, generating code, and more.

In this project, `build.rs` performs crucial tasks:

1. **PostgreSQL Linkage:** It handles the linkage to the PostgreSQL library. If the build script cannot find the required PostgreSQL library, it will cause a build failure, hence the need to set up environment variables correctly, as mentioned in the [Solving PostgreSQL linkage issue](#solving_postgresql_linkage_issue) section.
   
2. **Node.js Integration:** It ensures the correct Node.js version is used and runs the build for the Node.js part of the project, housed in the `grapesjs-tailwind` directory. This is vital for integrating GrapesJS, a JavaScript framework, into the Rust project.

3. **JavaScript File Inclusion:** To include the JavaScript file (`grapesjs-tailwind.min.js`) required for GrapesJS, the build script copies this file to a known location during compile time. The Rust code then includes the file content using `include_bytes!` from this known location. This approach is robust, portable, and does not rely on the absolute path of the file.

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation <a name="setup_and_installation"></a>

#### **1. Install Prerequisites** <a name="install_prerequisites"></a>
Before you start, make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, you can install it using `rustup`. Also, follow the instructions in the [Installing Node Version Manager (nvm) for Windows](#installing_node_version_manager_nvm_for_windows) section to set up Node.js.

#### **2. Resolve Known Issues** <a name="resolve_known_issues"></a>
- Follow the steps in the [Solving PostgreSQL linkage issue](#solving_postgresql_linkage_issue) section to resolve any PostgreSQL linkage issues.
- Address any additional linkage issues as described in the [Solving the Generated Project linkage issue on Windows](#solving_the_generated_project_linkage_issue_on_windows) section.

#### **3. Clone and Build the Project** <a name="clone_and_build_the_project"></a>
- Clone the project to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory and run `cargo build` to build the project.

#### **4. Verify the Build** <a name="verify_the_build"></a>
- Ensure that there are no errors during the build process.
- If any issues arise, refer to the [Known Issues](#known_issues) section and make sure all prerequisites are correctly installed and configured.

### üöÄ Running the Project <a name="running_the_project"></a>

Once you have resolved the known issues and understood the build process, you can run the project locally for development and testing purposes. Use `cargo run` to start the project, and follow the on-screen instructions or refer to the project documentation for using and testing the implemented features.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note <a name="note"></a>

Understanding the build process and resolving known issues are crucial steps in setting up the project. While they might seem cumbersome, they ensure that the project runs seamlessly across different environments and configurations, laying a solid foundation for development, testing, and deployment.

### Known Issues <a name="known_issues"></a>

***There are a couple known issues, but they are easy to fix.***

#### Solving PostgreSQL linkage issue <a name="solving_postgresql_linkage_issue"></a>

If you encounter an error like this: `LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'libpq.lib'`, it means the project is not able to find the libpq library. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. If you haven't already, download and install PostgreSQL binaries for Windows from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).
2. Make sure to install it in an easily accessible location, like `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\13\\`.
3. Set the `POSTGRES_LIB_PATH` environment variable pointing to your PostgreSQL lib directory where `libpq.lib` resides:
   - Press `Windows key -> Type 'Environment Variables' -> Click on 'Edit the system environment variables' -> Click the 'Environment Variables...' button -> Under the 'System Variables' section, click the 'New...' button -> For 'Variable name', enter 'POSTGRES_LIB_PATH'. For 'Variable value', enter the path to the directory containing `libpq.lib` -> Confirm and apply the changes. Remember, you might need to open a new command prompt or PowerShell window for the changes to take effect.
4. After you generate a website using rustyRoad, if you are on windows.
   - Create or edit the `config.toml` file inside the `.cargo` directory in your rustyroad project's root directory (create the `.cargo` directory if it doesn't exist). Add the following lines, replacing `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\13\\lib` with your actual path where your `libpq.lib` is located. Remember to use double backslashes `\\` for cross-platform compatibility.

    ```toml
    [target.'cfg(windows)']
    rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=/LIBPATH:C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\13\\lib"]
    ```

_Note: Replace `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\13\\lib` with your exact path where PostgreSQL is installed._

_Note: The Rust build script uses this `POSTGRES_LIB_PATH` environment variable._

#### Solving the Generated Project linkage issue on Windows

1. Navigate to your rustyroad project's root directory (where your `Cargo.toml` file is located).
    ```bash
    cd to/your/project/directory
    ```
2. Inside this directory, find the `.cargo` directory, or create it if it doesn't exist.

```bash
mkdir .cargo    # if .cargo directory doesn't exist
```

3. Inside the `.cargo` directory, create or edit the `config.toml` file.

```bash
cd .cargo
touch config.toml  # if config.toml doesn't exist
```

4. Open the `config.toml` file in your preferred text editor. Add the following lines to the `config.toml` file, replacing `C:\\ProgramData\\PostgreSQL\\16rc1\\lib` with the actual path (use double backslashes) where your `libpq.lib` file is located.

```toml
[target.'cfg(windows)']
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=/LIBPATH:C:\\ProgramData\\PostgreSQL\\16rc1\\lib"]
```

5. Save and close the file.
6. Now when you build your project again with `cargo build` or `cargo run`, the build should find the `libpq.lib` file correctly.

### Installing Node Version Manager (nvm) for Windows <a name="installing_node_version_manager_nvm_for_windows"></a>

The Rusty Road project uses Node.js, which we'll manage versions with by using Node Version Manager (nvm). To install nvm for Windows:

1. Visit the latest release page for nvm for Windows at https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
2. Download the `nvm-setup.zip` file.
3. Extract the zip file and run the installer (`nvm-setup.exe`).
4. Follow the instructions provided by the installer.
5. Once nvm is installed, close your terminal or command prompt and open a new one for the changes to take effect.
6. Verify that nvm is installed correctly by typing `nvm version` into your new terminal. If a version number is displayed, nvm has been installed successfully.

### Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

Rust is required to build and run Rusty Road. You can install Rust using rustup. rustup is a tool that helps manage Rust installations, it allows for installing multiple versions of Rust and switching between them easily.

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```


### Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

#### Crates.io <a name="crates_io"></a>
Rusty Road is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rustyroad). You can install it using cargo:

```
cargo install rustyroad
```

Bonus Step #1 (optional): Add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc file to make the rustyroad command available in your terminal:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Bonus Step #2 (optional): Create a symbolic link to the rustyroad command in your ~/.cargo/bin directory.
This will create a symlink from rustyroad to rr inside ~/.cargo/bin/ directory. 
Now you can invoke `rr` command which is just a symlink to rustyroad.

```
sudo ln -s ~/.cargo/bin/rustyroad /usr/local/bin/rr
```

(Windows users can download the executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/RileySeaburg/Rusty-Road/releases) and add it to their PATH.)


#### Installing from source <a name="installing_from_source"></a>

Clone the repository and run the setup script.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RustyRoad/RustyRoad
```

```
cd RustyRoad
```

```
cargo run
```
