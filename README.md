## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Rust Needs a Rails

I outlined this in a blog post here: https://rileyseaburg.com/posts/rust-needs-a-rails

- IDEAL: In a perfect world, Rust would have a framework that is as easy to use as Ruby on Rails. It would be
  easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to maintain. It would be fast, secure, and reliable. It would be
  extensible and customizable. It would be a joy to use.
- REALITY: Rust is a powerful language, but it is not easy to use. It is not easy to learn, and it is not easy to
  maintain. It is not fast, secure, or reliable. It is not extensible or customizable. It is not a joy to use even though it is the most loved programming language on [stack overflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages).
- CONSEQUENCES:
  - Web servers are insecure, because most languages are not as secure as Rust.
  - Web servers are slow, because most languages are not as fast as Rust.
  - Web servers are unreliable, because most languages are not as reliable as Rust.
  - Web servers are not extensible or customizable, because most languages are not as extensible or customizable as Rust.
  - Web servers are not a joy to use, because most languages are not as fun to use as Rust.



## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Rusty Road is a framework written in Rust that is based on Ruby on Rails. It is designed to provide the familiar conventions and ease of use of Ruby on Rails, while also taking advantage of the performance and efficiency of Rust.

## :dog: What is Rusty Road <a name = "Rusty_actix"></a>

Rusty Road is a framework written in Rust that is based on Ruby on Rails. It is designed to provide the familiar conventions and ease of use of Ruby on Rails, while also taking advantage of the performance and efficiency of Rust.

Rusty Road is intended to offer developers a powerful and reliable platform for building web applications using Rust, and its name incorporates a rust-themed crab pun in a playful and memorable way.

### Understanding Rusty Road

Rusty Road currently works with the actix web framework, the Diesel ORM, the Tera template engine, the SASS asset pipeline, and the PostgreSQL database. It also uses the dotenv crate to manage environment variables, and it uses the dotenv-linter crate to lint environment variables.

Because Rusty Road uses the actix web framework, the architecture is not exactly MVC

## üéà Current Features <a name="features"></a>

- Database migrations
- Database seeds
- Support for PostgreSQL
- Support for MySQL
- Support for SQLite
- Support for MongoDB (Planned)
- Routing (actix)
- Templating (Tera)
- CSS Framework (Tailwind CSS)

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- Rust is a relatively new language, and it is not as mature as Ruby on Rails.
- Rust is not as easy to use as Ruby on Rails.
- Rust has a borrow checker, which can make it difficult to use.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

- Add support for more database adapters.
- Add support for react.
- Add support for GraphQL.
- Add support for API based microservices.
- Add support for more asset pipelines.
- One click deployment to AWS, GCP, Azure, and Digital Ocean or provide a docker image.
- Add support for more authentication frameworks.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Known Issues

***There are a couple known issues, but they are easy to fix.***

#### Solving PostgreSQL linkage issue

If you encounter an error like this: `LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'libpq.lib'`, it means the project is not able to find the libpq library. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. If you haven't already, download and install PostgreSQL binaries for Windows from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).
2. Make sure to install it in an easily accessible location, like `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\13\\`.
3. Set the `POSTGRES_LIB_PATH` environment variable pointing to your PostgreSQL lib directory where `libpq.lib` resides:
   - Press `Windows key -> Type 'Environment Variables' -> Click on 'Edit the system environment variables' -> Click the 'Environment Variables...' button -> Under the 'System Variables' section, click the 'New...' button -> For 'Variable name', enter 'POSTGRES_LIB_PATH'. For 'Variable value', enter the path to the directory containing `libpq.lib` -> Confirm and apply the changes. Remember, you might need to open a new command prompt or PowerShell window for the changes to take effect.
4. After you generate a website using rustyRoad, if you are on windows.
   - Create or edit the `config.toml` file inside the `.cargo` directory in your rustyroad project's root directory (create the `.cargo` directory if it doesn't exist). Add the following lines, replacing `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\13\\lib` with your actual path where your `libpq.lib` is located. Remember to use double backslashes `\\` for cross-platform compatibility.

    ```toml
    [target.'cfg(windows)']
    rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=/LIBPATH:C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\13\\lib"]
    ```

_Note: Replace `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\13\\lib` with your exact path where PostgreSQL is installed._

_Note: The Rust build script uses this `POSTGRES_LIB_PATH` environment variable._

#### Solving the Generated Project linkage issue on Windows

1. Navigate to your rustyroad project's root directory (where your `Cargo.toml` file is located).
    ```bash
    cd to/your/project/directory
    ```
2. Inside this directory, find the `.cargo` directory, or create it if it doesn't exist.

```bash
mkdir .cargo    # if .cargo directory doesn't exist
```

3. Inside the `.cargo` directory, create or edit the `config.toml` file.

```bash
cd .cargo
touch config.toml  # if config.toml doesn't exist
```

4. Open the `config.toml` file in your preferred text editor. Add the following lines to the `config.toml` file, replacing `C:\\ProgramData\\PostgreSQL\\16rc1\\lib` with the actual path (use double backslashes) where your `libpq.lib` file is located.

```toml
[target.'cfg(windows)']
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=/LIBPATH:C:\\ProgramData\\PostgreSQL\\16rc1\\lib"]
```

5. Save and close the file.
6. Now when you build your project again with `cargo build` or `cargo run`, the build should find the `libpq.lib` file correctly.

### Installing Node Version Manager (nvm) for Windows

The Rusty Road project uses Node.js, which we'll manage versions with by using Node Version Manager (nvm). To install nvm for Windows:

1. Visit the latest release page for nvm for Windows at https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
2. Download the `nvm-setup.zip` file.
3. Extract the zip file and run the installer (`nvm-setup.exe`).
4. Follow the instructions provided by the installer.
5. Once nvm is installed, close your terminal or command prompt and open a new one for the changes to take effect.
6. Verify that nvm is installed correctly by typing `nvm version` into your new terminal. If a version number is displayed, nvm has been installed successfully.

### Prerequisites

Rust is required to build and run Rusty Road. You can install Rust using rustup. rustup is a tool that helps manage Rust installations, it allows for installing multiple versions of Rust and switching between them easily.

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```


### Installing

#### Crates.io
Rusty Road is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rustyroad). You can install it using cargo:

```
cargo install rustyroad
```

Bonus Step #1 (optional): Add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc file to make the rustyroad command available in your terminal:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Bonus Step #2 (optional): Create a symbolic link to the rustyroad command in your ~/.cargo/bin directory.
This will create a symlink from rustyroad to rr inside ~/.cargo/bin/ directory. 
Now you can invoke `rr` command which is just a symlink to rustyroad.

```
sudo ln -s ~/.cargo/bin/rustyroad /usr/local/bin/rr
```

(Windows users can download the executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/RileySeaburg/Rusty-Road/releases) and add it to their PATH.)


#### Installing from source

Clone the repository and run the setup script.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RustyRoad/RustyRoad
```

```
cd RustyRoad
```

```
cargo run
```
