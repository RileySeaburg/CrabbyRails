# How to contribute to Rusty Road

## Reporting bugs

We always welcome bug reports, API suggestions, and pull requests. If you find a bug, please report it by opening an issue on GitHub. Even better, you can submit a pull request with a fix.

Here are some tips for writing a good bug report:

* **Search existing issues first.** Someone might have already reported the same issue that you're experiencing.
* **Include details about your configuration and environment.** If possible, include a link to a GitHub gist containing a minimal example that reproduces the problem. If you're using a version of Rusty Road that you've compiled yourself, please include the commit hash.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs.** A picture says a thousand words, and animated GIFs are even better.
* **Include console output.** If you're reporting a crash, include the full stack trace. If the program prints an error message, include that error message.
* **One bug per report.** If you're experiencing multiple bugs, please open multiple issues.
* **A High Level Overview of the Issue.** Explain what you're trying to achieve (e.g. "I'm trying to do X, and I expect Y to happen, but Z happens instead").
* **Steps to Reproduce the Problem.** Include a minimal example that reproduces the problem. If possible, please use a GitHub gist.
* **Specifications.** Include the version of Rusty Road that you're using, as well as the version of Rust and the operating system that you're using.
